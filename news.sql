While Swift’s fans were expecting her to announce her fifth re-recorded album, Reputation (Taylor’s Version), the pop star shocked everyone by revealing a new project, her eleventh studio album. </p><p>In her speech, Swift said she wanted to thank fans by letting them in on a secret she’d been keeping for two years. “My brand-new album comes out April 19th,” Swift said during her acceptance speech. “It’s called The Tortured Poets Department. I’m going to go and post the cover right now backstage.”</p><p>While kicking off the next leg of the Eras Tour in Tokyo on Wednesday, Swift gave a little context on the work she\'d put into the album.</p><p>\"I’ve been working on Tortured Poets since right after I turned in Midnights,\" she told the crowd. \"I’ve been working on it for about two years. I worked on it throughout the US tour. Soon we’ll get to hear it together.”</p><p>The Tortured Poets Department will be released on April 19. Swift made the album available for pre-order on her website after announcing it at the Grammys. </p><p>On Monday, Swift dropped the official tracklist for the new album. The Tortured Poets Department will feature 16 songs and one bonus track, titled “The Manuscript.” Other titles include: “I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can),” “My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys,” “But Daddy I Love Him,” and “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.”</p><p>The Tortured Poets Department has two features. The first track, “Fortnight,” includes a feature by Post Malone and the song “Florida!!!” features Florence and the Machine.</p><p>Following Swift’s announcement, fans online began looking for meanings and clues behind the details she gave. According to some on the internet, the title of the album seems to nod to her ex-boyfriend, Joe Alwyn. In 2022, during Alwyn’s Actors on Actors interview with Paul Mescal, he revealed that he was in a group chat with Mescal and actor Andrew Scott called “The Tortured Man Club.”</p>', 'imagesED/image2.png', 2, 1, 2, '2024-01-31 14:18:04', '2024-02-07 13:56:04'),

It\'s European leg, however, remains unchanged at this time.</p><p>According to a release from Opium, it stated that \"Playboi Carti is gearing up for his new album and the Antagonist Tour will follow once there is new music to share with fans.” The 43-date global trek included 10 international shows visiting cities such as Brussels, Paris, Milan among others.</p><p>In the build-up of the tour, Playboi Carti has dropped a trove of tracks, most recently \"BACKROOMS\" featuring Travis Scott. All four of these singles are not available on digital streaming platforms, and can only be found on the rapper\'s Finsta and YouTube channels</p><p>This is the now the fourth alteration the ANTAGONIST Tour has experienced. Its US dates were initially planned to begin in September, but were moved to January 2024. The Euro dates were then pushed to November, and soon after the entire tour. Nevertheless, Playboi Carti is planning a comeback in the new year amid a historic year for his label, with his album MUSIC looming.</p><p>Recent features in Numero Berlin and Re-Edition Magazine are telling of the \"important\" music he\'s about to share. \"It\'s very important to me because I feel like I have something to prove. I\'m just excited, you know? This is my moment, this is the one for me,\" he told Numero. \"I think it\'s going to be my best album because I\'m just popping it. It starts with music. That\'s it. As long as I got that, it\'s up.\"</p><p>It\'s been nearly three years since Carti dropped Whole Lotta Red, and fans are starving. Word of a joint album with NBA YoungBoy was the latest in Carti lore before any news of its existence disappeared out of thin air. Singles in \"DIFFERENT DAY,\" \"HOODBYAIR,\" \"2024\" and \"BACKROOMS\" have held over and excited vamps in the meantime.</p><p>News of the ANTAGONIST Tour followed an \"00*CTOBER” takeover from Destroy Lonely, Homixide Gang and Ken Carson - all three of which dropping full-length albums. Playboi Carti was surprisingly active in 2023, headlining a slew of festivals such as Rolling Loud, Sunmer Smash and Wireless Festival. He openly praised what Ken and Lone have accomplished earlier this year, making their way as bona fide superstars of our generation.</p><p>\"Thank you for supporting my label, thank you for supporting Ken and Destroy Lonely,\" he said at Rolling Loud Portugal. \"Thank you for supporting my artists, F1LTHY, everybody.

You be the judge, but Trippie Redd definitely made his case with his third project on the year, SAINT MICHAEL.</p><p>Initially holding seven tracks (Nov. 10), the 1400 rapper dropped its full version on Friday (Nov. 24). Packed with 17 songs and features from K Suave and YTB Fatt, new highlights like the long-teased \"Wizard 101,\" \"Pepe Lit,\" \"Psychotic Lunatic,\" \"Skeletons\" and others further prove SAINT MICHAEL\'s breadth of infection, evident in Trippie\'s year-end revival.</p><p>Following January\'s Mansion Musik and A Love Letter To You 5, the Canton, Ohio native remains as one of the few SoundCloud-era torchbearers still holding its flame. SAINT MICHAEL feels reminiscent of this era, yet sees Trippie reside in a space of fluidity and freedom. </p><p>Touting Jersey club bops produced by Cash Cobain (\"Pray 4 Us\"), sample-clad ALLTY3 scorchers (\"Van Cleef Island,\" \"1716 Osage\") and a timestamp ode a la Drake on \"7am in Ohio,\" Trip is in his bag - especially on \"Skeletons,\" \"Pepe Lit” and “Van Cleef Island:\"</p><p>Marked by sets at Summer Smash and Rolling Loud, the red-dreaded emcee\'s 2023 was also highlighted by guest spots. Lending vocals to Tory Lanez\'s Alone At Prom loosie \"Hurts Me\" - which ended up on the album\'s deluxe this month (Nov. 17) — SAINT MICHAEL is the album Trippie fans have been waiting on since ALLTY4 dropped. Moments with K Suave and Fatt feel more meaningful due to their ties with Redd (see how Teezo Touchdown, Suave and Trip are all long-linked). </p><p>It\'s not to say Mansion and ALLTY5 didn\'t have their highs (\"Praying For Love,\" \"Knight Crawler\"), but it\'s clear the effort and purpose Trippie possesses on SM is as natural as his performances.</p><p>What Redd brings into 2024, though, hopes to keep this same type of energy.

Holding 18 tracks and features from 00 partner-in-crime Lone and Lil Uzi Vert – who\'s referred to as their \"uncle\" online - Carson excites over whirly, sizzling beats fashioned by F1LTHY, 808 Mafia and more that send you to another world. Simply put, it\'s Carson\'s most polished and impressive effort yet, earning 47,000 first-week units and a No. 11 debut on the Billboard 200 - the highest out of any Opium artist so far.</p><p>Ken kept spooky season alive with the visual to \"Fighting My Demons\" directed by Cole Bennett. Arriving on Halloween night, the eerie horror-filled video depicts Carson through a series of staticky, control room monitors, surrounded by bloodied walls captured through night vision lenses - turning up fighting the demons that engulf him.</p><p>\r\nKen\'s cadences bring similar feelings of Whole Lotta Red to the forefront of his essence, bending and pitching his voice to where he almost sounds unrecognizable - outwardly pushing his sound forward. Tracks like \"Vampire Hour,\" \"Jennifer\'s Body,\" \"Singapore,\" \"Paranoid,\" \"Like This\" and more have reasserted Ken\'s calls for his top dog status within the Opium label - bringing out Playboi Carti, F1LTHY and Lone during his album launch event in New York City. It seemed to be a taste of what\'s to come, as the Opium crew are set to head out on their \"ANTAGONIST Tour\" in 2024.</p><p>AGC was initially set to drop on July 17, and was teased by the X rapper through a slew of sporadic Instagram Live snippets this summer. He also teased \"It\'s Over\" in a now-deleted tweet, however, it never came to light. Carson said the album\'s release date was \"out of his hands\" in an interview with OnAmp in late August.</p><p>Additionally, AGC draws further anticipation for Ken and Lone\'s forthcoming collab album - sure to set ablaze the dark side of underground listeners. Prior to its release, Ken previewed collabs with Uzi and Lone as well as 070 Shake, with the Shake record seemingly left for her upcoming album.</p><p>Opium\'s prolific 2023 isn\'t all thanks to Lone and Ken, but also Homixide Gang and the loosely-affiliated Sid Shyne - who joined the rage-inducing duo on their \"SNOT OR NOT Tour\" this past May. With more music in sight for the entire 00 roster, Ken is looking to double down on his star power, stemming from Project X and his debut album X in July 2022. Ken and Lone garnered more hype for their joint tape when they united on their fourth track together \"money & sex,\" offering their fifth, sixth, seventh efforts on \"Paranoid,\" \"Singapore\" and \"Like This\" on AGC.</p><p>Tailor-made for the mosh-pit, Carson\'s lead single \"i need u\" was the only indication of a new project prior to his activity on social media. One thing\'s for certain: Carson\'s A GREAT CHAOS is as chaotic and ominous as advertised.</p>', 'imagesED/image5.png', 3, 2, 3, '2024-01-14 14:46:41', '2024-01-15 14:00:41'),

Carti, who is currently prepping his new Music album, showed up in a black mask he said he was gifted from Kanye West.

The Grammys finally unveiled the Best Rap Song category for the 46th Grammy Awards in 2004. The first honor went to Eminem for his diamond-selling track \"Lose Yourself,\" marking his ninth Grammy win altogether at the time.</p><p>The Grammys and the genre of hip-hop have long-held a contentious relationship with one another. One reason that tension remains is credited to Macklemore’s 2014 wins for Best Rap Song with \"Thrift Shop,\" as well as Best Rap Album with The Heist. In the process, many fans thought that Macklemore’s competitors at the time, Kendrick Lamar, Drake and Jay-Z, were snubbed. Mainly, K-Dot, when Macklemore won Best Rap Album win for The Heist over good kid, m.A.A.d city.</p><p>Despite moments like that, there have been positive experiences like \"Jesus Walks\" by Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) winning in 2005, \"Lollipop\" by Lil Wayne winning in 2009, and \"Humble.\" by Kendrick Lamar winning in 2018. The nominees and winners in this award category have mostly been validated through the court of public opinion. More recently, the wins speak to the different states and eras of hip-hop.</p><p>The 2022 ceremony boasted many notable moments and wins from last year\'s hardest-working rappers. Ye’s 2022 Best Rap Song win for \"Jail\" featuring Jay-Z not only rejoined a duo well-favored within hip-hop, but also spoke volumes to Ye’s long-standing reign within the genre as a producer and artist. In 2023, it was important to recognize the new school as well as the veterans. Artists like Jack Harlow’s \"Churchill Downs\" with Drake were nominated alongside Kendrick Lamar’s \"The Heart Part 5.\" \"Pushin P\" by Gunna and \"Wait For U\" by Future were also contenders.</p>', 'imagesED/image7.png', 4, 3, 4, '2024-02-04 14:10:51', '2024-02-04 16:09:51'),

The song marked Knopfler’s first credit as a film composer and earned him a BAFTA nomination. In recent times, the song is famously played at every Newcastle United game before the team take to the pitch.<p></p>Others recruited for the 2024 charity re-recording are Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour, Eric Clapton, The Who’s Pete Townshend, Joan Jett, Nile Rogers, Joe Bonamassa, Sheryl Crow, Peter Frampton, Toto’s Steve Lukather and Hank Marvin.<p></p>Sam Fender will also contribute to the single, alongside Rage Against The Machine’s Tom Morello, Steve Vai, Keith Urban, Eagles’ Joe Walsh, Rush’s Alex Liveson and Duran Duran’s Andy Taylor.

The latter of which recently stepped down as the curator for the Teenager Cancer Trust gigs.<p></p>“What I really want to do, more than anything else, is just to thank each and every one for this sterling response. I really had no idea that it was going to be like this,” said Knopfler in a press release.<p></p>“It hit Guy and I quite early on that we had to extend this piece somehow, to take in the number of people who joined in. Before I knew where I was, Pete Townshend had come into my studio armed with a guitar and an amp. And that first Pete power chord…man, I tell you — we were in that territory, and it was just fantastic. And it went on from there.<p></p>“Eric [Clapton] came in, played great, just one tasty lick after another. Then Jeff Beck’s contribution arrived and that was spellbinding. I think what we’ve had is an embarrassment of riches. The whole thing was a high point.”<p></p>Funds raised by the single will go to the Teenage Cancer Trust, and the project has been further supported by leading guitar makers, who have donated a total of 8 guitars to be signed by the contributing artists.

In 2016 a recording from 1988 resurfaced, in which Jackson revealed he disliked the comparisons of him to Prince, and labelled the ‘Purple Rain’ singer as “one of the rudest people I have ever met”.</p><p>Additionally, part of the conflict arose after Prince turned down the opportunity to collaborate with Jackson on his hit 1987 album ‘Bad’ – namely due to his reluctance to sing the line “Your butt is mine” on the title track (via Express).</p><p>The feud between the two was speculated to be the reason why Prince did not take up the offer to play on ‘We Are The World’, despite already being in the same city at the time for the American Music Awards.</p><p>Now, Tom Bahler, who Quincy Jones tasked with arranging the vocals on the record, has weighed in on the discussion and suggested that Prince may have turned down the opportunity because he was “afraid” of Jackson.</p><p>“I had a feeling Prince had a problem with men. With him, everything was with women. It made him feel good,” Bahler told Rolling Stone‘s Music Now podcast.</p><p>He also said he thinks the disagreement about the lyric in ‘Bad’ was “one of his excuses” to not work with Jackson. “I think if anything, he was afraid of Michael,” he said. “This is pure conjecture on my part. Michael was not afraid of him. Michael wasn’t afraid of anybody. He loved everybody.”</p><p>As highlighted by MusicRadar, Bahler’s relationship with Jackson can be traced back to 1979, when Jackson released Bahler’s ‘She’s Out Of My Life’ as a single from his ‘Off The Wall’ album.</p><p>As well as speculation that Prince did not appear on ‘We Are The World’ because of his dislike of Jackson, alternate theories have also suggested that the artist didn’t take part in the recording because he wanted to play the guitar on the track instead – a decision which Quincy Jones allegedly turned down.</p><p>The Greatest Night In Pop is available on Netflix now.</p><p>In other Michael Jackson news, last month it was revealed that the upcoming biopic on the singer is set to arrive on April 18, 2025.</p><p>The film will be titled Michael, and it will star the musician’s nephew Jaafar Jackson, 27, in the title role.

During the set, he went on to introduce his hit song ‘Cry Me A River’ by telling the crowd: “I’d like to take this opportunity to apologise to absolutely fucking nobody.”</p><p>While the former *NSYNC didn’t clarify who his retracted apology was aimed towards, the track has been speculated to be about his relationship with Spears, which ran between 1999 and 2002. In the accompanying music video, a blonde actress resembling Spears was featured and the lyrics saw Timberlake sing about being cheated on.</p><p>Spears later described the video as “a woman who looks like me cheats on him and he wanders around sad in the rain”.</p><p>She added that the media saw her as a “harlot who’d broken the heart of America’s golden boy” when in reality she was “comatose in Louisiana” trying to mend her broken heart while Timberlake was “happily running around Hollywood”.</p><p>However, the statement may have also been about Janet Jackson and in relation to the 2004 Super Bowl Halftime show, where the singer exposed Jackson’s breast on live television. The gig on Wednesday happened to fall on the same day that the moment took place, 20 years earlier.</p><p>Elsewhere, Britney Spears also appeared to take back an apology she issued.</p><p>Taking to her private Instagram account yesterday (February 1), she shared a post with the caption: “Someone told me someone was talking shit about me on the streets !!!”</p><p>“Do you want to bring it to the court or will you go home crying to your mom like you did last time??? I’m not sorry !!!” she added.</p><p>Like with Timberlake, it is not clear who Spears’ statement was aimed towards, although it does come just days after she initially offered support for the singer following the release of his new comeback single ‘Selfish’.</p><p>“I wanna apologise for some of the things I wrote about in my book,” Spears wrote on Instagram on Sunday evening (January 28), referring to her memoir, The Woman In Me. “If I offended any of the people I genuinely care about I am deeply sorry.”</p><p>“I also wanted to say I am in love with Justin Timberlake’s new song ‘Selfish’ It is soo good and how come every time I see Justin and Jimmy together I laugh so hard ???” she wrote, sharing a clip of the singer on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.

In the memoir, she spoke openly about her personal life, career, family and 13-year conservatorship, as well as admitting that she had an abortion while dating the former *NSYNC star.</p><p>She said that their pregnancy came as a “surprise” and suggested that it was Timberlake’s attitude towards the discovery that played a major role in her having an abortion.</p><p>“For me, it wasn’t a tragedy. But Justin definitely wasn’t happy about the pregnancy. He said we weren’t ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young,” she wrote (via Sky News). “If it had been left up to me alone, I never would have done it.”</p><p>She also described the abortion as “one of the most agonising things I have ever experienced in my life”.</p><p>Later this year, Timberlake is set to embark on his newly-announced ‘Forget The World’ US tour, marking his first string of live dates in five years.</p><p>As for Spears, earlier this week the pop star Britney teased fans with news of an upcoming project, seemingly titled ‘Sex & Diamonds’.</p>', 'imagesED/image18.png', 4, 2, 4, '2024-03-17 12:03:17', '2024-03-17 22:54:17'),

At first, he’s speechless. He stays silent so long, in fact, that it seems like the line may have disconnected. Then he exhales deeply, muffling the phone receiver. Finally, he laughs, sort of in disbelief, or maybe something else.</p><p>“I’m not here for titles, but that… It sounds insane,” he says, finally putting his thoughts into words. “It sounds amazing. I\'m just here making a living, being creative. I did not know or expect anything like this would happen at this level. I always thought it was kind of like a hobby… Maybe not a hobby, but I didn\'t think I would be the best producer.” </p><p>What may have started as a creative pastime when he was young has now propelled BNYX around the globe, placing him in rooms with some of the biggest names in music. His production style, which he describes as a “blend of different genres,” has become a highly coveted sound for both emerging and veteran artists.</p><p>After years of work in the underground, including efforts as part of the Working on Dying collective, BNYX\'s career skyrocketed in 2023. Kicking off the year, he partnered with Yeat on AftërLyfe, producing nearly half of the 22-song tracklist. From there, he caught the attention of A-list stars like Drake. Producing the No. 2 Billboard hit “Search & Rescue,” BNYX impressed Drake so much that he was invited on the road for the It’s All a Blur Tour and ultimately produced several tracks on For All the Dogs. From there, BNYX was arguably the most in-demand hip-hop producer on the planet, producing songs for everyone from Travis Scott to Lil Uzi Vert to Quavo to Lil Tecca to Nicki Minaj.</p><p>\" I did not know or expect anything like this would happen at this level. \"BNYX acknowledges that he’s worked with basically everyone he’s had on his bucket list, but his standout moment from last year was working with Drake. “It was really cool being with him, every day in this studio, going through ideas, building the album,” he says. “And going on tour for the first time was crazy, just going to every city, seeing these different places and all these different crowds. It was inspiring. I work with a lot of different artists closely, but I never worked with an artist that closely before.”</p><p>When BNYX hopped on the phone with Complex, he was in Toronto preparing to travel to New York the next day. While he can\'t reveal the reason for being up North in the middle of winter, you can make an educated guess. Many details of his career-changing year will also have to remain off the record, but what he was able to share is both mind-blowing and hilarious. This includes anecdotes about connecting with Drake, his getting stranded in Malibu outside Rick Rubin’s studio, and much more. As you’ll see, his knack for storytelling and comedic timing are brilliant. The interview, lightly edited for clarity, is below. (And check out our Spotify playlist of the biggest and best songs he produced in 2023 here).</p><p>What was the turning point when you realized music could be a career? After I dropped out of college, because they raised the tuition. This was my freshman year. My sophomore year I started working for AT&T, and I did that for maybe three and a half years. And then, you know, two years in, I was like, “This can\'t be it, bro.”</p><p>I\'ve been doing music as a hobby since I was 9, in the studio with my dad, because we had a studio at the house and that let me look into the actual music business and see what this thing is. So while I was at work, I would watch hella YouTube videos, read all of the different types of interviews and things on networking, because I was already good at music. I was just trying to make it a business.</p><p>Then I started reaching out to people, telling people about my different skills—not just making beats but helping them with lyrics. If there was a producer that needed a sample cleared, I could replay that sample, so all you\'ll have to clear is the publishing instead of the master side of the music. </p><p>Eventually, I ended up getting one of my first cuts in 2017. It was a song called “South Beach” with French Montana, Ty Dolla $ign, and Quavo. It was my first record. I was still working a job. So it wasn\'t life-changing money, to the point I was like, “Oh, I\'m gonna quit my job.” But it was kind of cool, because if I could do it this one time, maybe I can do it again. </p><p>I kept working for another year. I got a couple more, then I was flying back and forth to Cali, so I would meet a whole lot of people by making those trips. Eventually I was like: I think I need to be in Los Angeles because Philly is just not cutting it. So I made a goal. I was going to Uber. I took out my 401(k) that I had for my job. There was a huge penalty for doing it so early, and it wasn\'t that much money in there.</p><p>My goal was to start doing Uber and then drive to L.A. and kind of live in my car until I figured things out, or just couch surf or whatever. Philly has mad potholes and it was snowing, so I ended up fucking up my car while driving Uber, and I ended up spending all that money that I had fixing the car. So it got to the point where there was no money left to go to [L.A.]. This was 2018, 2019. </p><p>At what point did you link with the Working on Dying Collective? I was looking for a new manager towards the end of 2020. His name is Ness and he manages all the guys in Working on Dying. I actually met him two years prior in 2019. When I found out I was having a child, I felt like I needed to revamp my business—like the business side of the music. At that time, I was getting placements here and there, and I was making OK money, kind of minimum wage-ish. But when I found out I was having a kid, I felt like I needed to completely start over.</p><p>So I got a new manager, and he took me in, introduced me to [Working on Dying founder] F1lthy. F1lthy introduced me to Zack Fox, who introduced me to Uzi and that team, and we ended up doing a song for Space Jam. I ended up working with Zack Fox, and then it led [to] me working on a lot of things for TV, because he writes for TV shows and he acts in TV shows. Then things just started picking up.</p><p>At that time, I also met Yeat as well. He had just dropped a record called Alive, and I heard that project, and I was like, “Whoa!” So I went and DM’d him, and come to find out, he already DM’d me. So literally that same day that I DM’d Yeat, he sent two songs. From there, I was like, “Yo, we got to lock in.” Then four months later, he starts blowing up with the bell song [“Get Busy”]. We went along this journey, and now we\'re here two years later. </p><p>You kicked off 2023 by working with Yeat on AftërLyfe. What do you remember about working on the project and building your relationship with Yeat? I feel like everything changed after that project. That project was out the way, flawless. Three of those songs are platinum. But I\'m not gonna lie, it was so much pressure. I was like, I got this small window. We need to capitalize on this.</p><p>My goal was to try and stand out from the usual production that he was getting. My goal would be to not make them do the same things because I read all blogs. I\'m on Reddit fan pages. I\'m very active. I\'m in every group chat talking to the fans to just see what they\'re saying, what they like, and what they don\'t like. And a lot of it was: “He\'s always doing the same thing.”</p><p>So my goal was to send beats that were in his world but something different, like with the track “Nun I’d Change.” I sent that record because I was running out of ideas. I didn’t have anything hard. Everything I was making, that was hard, sounded like everything else. So I didn\'t even wanna send it.</p><p>So me and my homie and his girl came to the crib, and we were making dinner, and I was saying, “Yo, bro, I\'m not inspired. Play me some shit.” He\'s a crazy guitar player. So he plays into this drum beat, and I\'m like, “This is hard!” I was like, hold up, let me lay this bass line down [sounds out instrumentation]. I didn’t know if [Yeat] was going to like this, but I sent it. So we sent the beat, he does the song the next day, and I\'m in the house screaming, like, “Yo, it\'s over!” I was playing it on repeat.

The credits are incomplete on some streaming services, however, Genius.com has a detailed list of collaborators, along with transcriptions of the NSFW and at times offensive lyrics.</p><p>Sources tell Variety that the original upload of the album, which was released sometime in the wee hours of Saturday morning, was not the correct, official version, but it has since been replaced with the official one. The album originally was not available on Spotify, possibly due to an apparently chaotic rollout from West’s team, but was posted onto the service early Saturday afternoon. A rep for West has confirmed to Variety that the version of the album now available on streaming services is the “correct” one.</p><p>The album is apparently the first in a trilogy that was originally scheduled to drop on Thursday, with the second volume slated for March 8, and the third following on April 5 — but most if not all of West-related releases in recent years have arrived later, often much later, than originally announced; his 2018 album “Yandhi” never came out at all.</p><p>The album appears to be released under West’s Yzy brand, as none of the other usual record label credits appear; West’s career-long relationships with Def Jam Recordings and Sony Music Publishing were allowed to lapse in 2021 as the artist’s behavior became more controversial, climaxing (for the moment, anyway) last year with his long string of antisemitic comments that torpedoed most of his branding deals and alienated all but his biggest fans. The pair were said to be seeking a distributor for the album — it seems unlikely that any of the major music companies will go near them — vinyl, CD and download versions of “Vultures 1” are available from West’s Yeezy website.</p><p>As was the case with West’s last full album, “Donda,” the release of “Vultures” was preceded by a series of public listening events in major cities, this time in Chicago and the New York City borough of Queens. The album does not appear to include the sample of a live Ozzy Osbourne recording of Black Sabbath’s “Iron Man” that enraged that artist and his manager-wife Sharon — which was used during the public listening sessions — who spoke out against West’s antisemitic comments and refused to clear the sample. However, a brief vocal snippet that sounds like Osbourne can be heard on the album’s closing track, “King,” although it could just as easily be someone imitating him.</p><p>Nicki Minaj also refused to clear the use of their 2018 collaboration “New Body,” which was apparently slated for inclusion on the album; there were also issues around the use of the Backstreet Boys song “Backstreet’s Back.”</p><p>Variety‘s review of the album — which, also as usual, has changed with each public airing — will be publishing in the coming days.</p>', 'imagesED/image21.png', 6, 2, 6, '2024-02-13 13:07:36', '2024-02-21 15:01:36'),

The patriotic song was written by Katharine Lee Bates in 1895 and has been performed over the decades by the likes of Elvis Presley, Bing Crosby and Jennifer Lopez.</p><p>During Post’s performance, the cameras panned to the stands, where Taylor Swift was seen swaying along with her arm around actor Blake Lively. When the pop star noticed she was on the big screen, she looked surprised before laughing with Lively.</p><p>Following Post’s rendition, Reba McEntire took to the field to perform the US national anthem, ‘The Star Spangled Banner’.</p><p>Meanwhile, Usher has said his halftime performance will honour Black musical legacy. “I think about what our country has represented for Black artists, having to, at some point, go through kitchens to even be able to perform for an audience,” he told Good Morning America. “They had to leave back through that same door, you know, fearing for their lives as they went to the next state to do the same thing.</p><p>“So I’m coming through the front door with this one. I think about all the R&B performers who are carrying this moment.”</p><p>Alicia Keys has been confirmed as a special guest for Usher’s performance, with Justin Bieber also rumoured to be appearing. The latter has been spotted in Las Vegas ahead of the game, adding fuel to the fire.</p>', 'imagesED/image22.png', 5, 3, 5, '2024-02-11 12:17:29', '2024-02-12 11:26:22'),

The new record, titled ‘The Tortured Poets Department’, will be released on April 19.</p><p>Ahead of that release, her blockbuster concert film Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour will arrive on Disney+ globally on March 15.</p><p>This year’s Super Bowl saw Usher take to the stage for the Halftime show where he brought out Alicia Keys for the performance.</p><p>The R&B star also welcomed a host of other guests throughout the set, including H.E.R. on guitar during ‘U Got It Bad’ and will.i.am for ‘OMG’. The latter also saw Usher recreate a roller-skating performance from his Las Vegas residency.</p><p>Lil Jon then appeared in the on-field crowd for a snippet of his song ‘Turn Down For What’ before joining the headliner and Ludacris for ‘Yeah!’.</p>', 'imagesED/image23.png', 2, 1, 2, '2024-02-11 09:39:25', '2024-02-12 23:10:12'),
